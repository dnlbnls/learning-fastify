With all that I learned I tried for myself to create a basic to-do app REST API with Fasitfy
run node server
server.js "runs" app.js wich contain the routes and logic
todos.json is where I'm storing my to-do's, for now updating the file when the API create, update or delete
probably better to use SQLite or something like that, but for learning purposes I wanted to start easy

Node v20.16.0
